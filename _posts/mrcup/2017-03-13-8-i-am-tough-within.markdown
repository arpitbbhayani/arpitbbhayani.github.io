 description: After being pushed to the ground, Kipo was hurt, he was in pain; As he tried to stand up all he saw was a huge-guy. He almost broke into tears with the pain he was experiencing and the thought of what other might think of him. He immediately ran towards the bathroom and locked himself up in a toilet. He started crying. He was experiencing a whirlpool of feelings; He was sad, angry, hurt and worried at the same time.

After being pushed to the ground, Kipo was hurt, he was in pain; As he tried to stand up all he saw was a huge-guy. He almost broke into tears with the pain he was experiencing and the thought of what other might think of him. He immediately ran towards the bathroom and locked himself up in a toilet. He started crying. He was experiencing a whirlpool of feelings; He was sad, angry, hurt and worried at the same time.

He thought of running away to home and never return back, but then he realized that he will get a lot of scolding from his mother if he did this. Since this was not a solution, he then thought of sitting and spending whole day in the bathroom and never return to the classroom that day and hope that everyone forgets everything that happened happened by tomorrow. This also did not seem a good option to him as it was not the loss of that huge-fat-potato guy, but his own, and he realized that. After few moments, when emotion of anger took over, he stopped crying and told himself “You may cry, but you are tough within!” which urged him to go, fight and beat that huge-fat-potato guy.

He angrily opened the door and started rushing towards the classroom but after few quick steps, he recalled a teaching from his grandpa, “No matter the situation don't let your emotions overpower”. So he kept his calm and returned back to the toilet seat and started thinking of some way to teach that huge-fat-potato-porker a lesson.

Kipo is shy, but he is also very smart. He thought of a plan … a plan to teach that huge-fat-potato-porker-lard-ass a lesson. With a wicked smile on his face he came out of the bathroom and stared moving towards classroom.

What is the plan?
If everything worked according to the plan, will Kipo get his seat back?
Where was Nick when Kipo locked himself up in the bathroom?
