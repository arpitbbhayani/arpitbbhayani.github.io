Mr. Cup saw some water spilled over the airplane. He is afraid that he may have accidentally broken everyone's favourite toy and once his friends find out this, they might stop hanging out with him and he will be all alone, just like the old times.

Mr. Cup is surely over thinking but his past made him to over think and be skeptical over everything. Back then he used to have his meals alone every single day. He was so alone that the only acquaintance he had was the delivery guy who used to deliver pizza to his place. Poor guy ðŸ˜”

But now his life changed, he has a "life", he has some amazing friends and he doesn't want to lose them at any cost!

Why was Mr. Cup so alone, did anything terrible happened?
Will friends find out about broken airplane?

Stay tuned!
