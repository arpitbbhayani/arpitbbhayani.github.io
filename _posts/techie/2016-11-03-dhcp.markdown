An IP address is the identity of a host or a computer device while connected to any network. When you connect your computer to a LAN or internet, the IP address and other information like subnet mask etc are assigned to your computer automatically.

DHCP is used to control the network configuration of a host through a remote server. It is an excellent alternative to the time-consuming manual configuration of network settings on a host or a network device.

## How it works?

DHCP works on a client-server model. Being a protocol, it has itâ€™s own set of messages that are exchanged between client and server.

## DHCP Steps
1. When the client computer (or device) boots up or is connected to a network, a `DHCPDISCOVER` message is sent from the client to the server. As there is no network configuration information on the client so the message is sent with `0.0.0.0` as source address and `255.255.255.255` as destination address. The transport protocol used for this message is **UDP** and the port number used is **67**. The client enters the initializing stage during this step.
2. When the DHCP server receives the `DHCPDISCOVER` request message then it replies with a `DHCPOFFER` message. This message contains all the network configuration settings required by the client. This message is sent as a broadcast (`255.255.255.255`) message for the client to receive it. UDP protocol is used at the transport layer with destination port as **68**.
3. The client forms a `DHCPREQUEST` message in reply to `DHCPOFFER` message and sends it to the server indicating it wants to accept the network configuration sent in the `DHCPOFFER` message. The `DHCPREQUEST` message will still contain the source address as `0.0.0.0` as the client is still not allowed to use the IP address passed to it through `DHCPOFFER` message.
4. Once the server receives `DHCPREQUEST` from the client, it sends the `DHCPACK` message indicating that now the client is allowed to use the IP address assigned to it.

## DHCP Lease
A DHCP lease is the amount of time that the DHCP server grants to the DHCP client permission to use a particular IP address. A typical server allows its administrator to set the lease time.
