                <p>Dimensions in simple terms are the number of axes you can move along. We all live in a 3D world but what if someone can access the 4th dimension. Lets talk about that …</p>

<h1 id="the-rule-of--n1th--dimension">The rule of <script type="math/tex">n+1^{th}</script> dimension</h1>
<hr />

<p>Imagine a plane <script type="math/tex">P</script> which is a 2D world and let there be 2 people <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>. <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a circle and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is a square. Since this is a 2D world, <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> can see everything on plane <script type="math/tex">P</script> but only as a <strong>line</strong>. They have no control over <script type="math/tex">Z-axis</script> which can give them a perception of what they actually are i.e. square or circle.</p>

<p>Suppose there is a person <script type="math/tex">C</script>, which is a Cube and has an access to <script type="math/tex">3^{rd}</script> dimension. We can deduce the following statements from this</p>

<p><a href="/static/images/fourth-dimension/1.jpg" data-lightbox="/static/images/fourth-dimension/1.jpg" data-title="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true">
    <img class="ui large centered stylish image" src="/static/images/fourth-dimension/1.jpg" alt="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true" />
</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> will see <script type="math/tex">C</script> as another fellow line as long as <script type="math/tex">C</script> intersects their world at <script type="math/tex">Z = 0</script>.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> will stop seeing <script type="math/tex">C</script> when it moves along <script type="math/tex">Z-axis</script> i.e. when <script type="math/tex">Z \neq 0</script></li>
</ul>

<p>This can be easily explained mathematically with concept of intersection and projections. But in naive terms, it can be explained with a statement “<script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> cannot see up or down (along <script type="math/tex">Z-axis</script>) hence they cannot know what is happening there”. So for <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>, <script type="math/tex">C</script> is only a line and nothing else.</p>

<p>So now we deduce a rule from this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a object moves along <script type="math/tex">3^{rd}</script> dimension, other 2 dimensional objects cannot perceive it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us extend it to 3D world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a object moves along <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension, other 3 dimensional objects cannot perceive it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in general we can say that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a object moves along <script type="math/tex">n+1^{th}</script> dimension, other <script type="math/tex">n</script> dimensional objects cannot perceive it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now your brain might be rushing and must be thinking a lot of crazy things that can be done with this. Lets analyze …</p>

<h1 id="where-the-hell-did-he-go">Where the hell did he go</h1>
<hr />
<p>You might have seen a magic trick where a person disappears from a place and shows up at another. You might also know how the trick it is done. Can this be done for real? <strong>YES</strong>, this can surely be done in real if one has an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension. How? lets dig deeper into it.</p>

<p>Suppose a magician <script type="math/tex">X</script> is at place <script type="math/tex">P1</script>. If he has an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension then he can simply move along it and reach place <script type="math/tex">P2</script> without even getting noticed. This is just an extension of rule mentioned above.</p>

<p>To explain it better lets go back to our <script type="math/tex">2D</script> example. Suppose Cube C rise up so that its <script type="math/tex">Z \neq 0</script>. Suddenly he will be invisible to <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>. <script type="math/tex">C</script> now moves <script type="math/tex">20</script> units to left and goes down to intersect at <script type="math/tex">Z = 0</script>. As soon as this happens <script type="math/tex">C</script> becomes visible to <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> all of a sudden.</p>

<p><a href="/static/images/fourth-dimension/2.jpg" data-lightbox="/static/images/fourth-dimension/2.jpg" data-title="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true">
    <img class="ui large centered stylish image" src="/static/images/fourth-dimension/2.jpg" alt="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true" />
</a></p>

<p>From the perspective of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>, <script type="math/tex">C</script> just disappeared from a place and showed up at another. So for them this was like the magic trick.</p>

<p>If we extend this explanation to our <script type="math/tex">3</script> dimensional world we can easily deduce how a person with an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension can disappear at place and shows up at another. So next time you see this trick … there might be a tiny possibility that the magician has an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension. So beware!</p>

<h1 id="the-saviour">The saviour</h1>
<hr />

<p>Since you live in <script type="math/tex">3</script> dimension and your <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension is exposed and free to access, a person with access to it can see through you. Lets find out how …</p>

<p>In our example of <script type="math/tex">2D</script> world, imagine there is a <script type="math/tex">2D</script> - tumor inside the square <script type="math/tex">A</script> that needs to be removed. He asks <script type="math/tex">B</script> for some help. <script type="math/tex">B</script> told him that he has no other option but cut him open and remove the tumor. <script type="math/tex">A</script> straight away said NO to this. Can this be done in any other simpler way?</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>YES</strong>. This can be done in a very very simple way but this requires access to higher dimensions. Suppose you enter this <script type="math/tex">2D</script> world but you still have an access to <script type="math/tex">3^{rd}</script> dimension, and the tumor is exposed from its 3rd dimension, you can access tumor directly pick it up and throw it away, without any need of cutting open <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>

<p><a href="/static/images/fourth-dimension/3.jpg" data-lightbox="/static/images/fourth-dimension/3.jpg" data-title="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true">
    <img class="ui large centered stylish image" src="/static/images/fourth-dimension/3.jpg" alt="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true" />
</a></p>

<p>If we just extend this example to our world, we can say that if someone has an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension then he can in so many ways be very very useful in healthcare. Some things that can be done are
* Bloodless Surgery
* tumor detection and removal
* Detect blood clotting in early stage
* Blood less transplantation of various organs, etc.</p>

<h1 id="the-phantom-thief">The Phantom Thief</h1>
<hr />
<p>What if a person with such amazing capabilities became a thief. This is will be very menial but we can at least spare a thought on this…</p>

<p>From last examples we see how a person with access to higher dimension can access anything directly without cutting open anything, so now since he is a thief, he can steal anything from any safe in this whole world without even getting noticed. This means no treasure can be kept safe from his hands, not even art like Picasso’s paintings are safe, nothing can be kept safe from him.</p>

<p><a href="/static/images/fourth-dimension/4.jpg" data-lightbox="/static/images/fourth-dimension/4.jpg" data-title="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true">
    <img class="ui large centered stylish image" src="/static/images/fourth-dimension/4.jpg" alt="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true" />
</a></p>

<p>He can just swoop in take the things and go off and no one will ever take a notice of this.</p>

<h1 id="the-perfect-murderer">The Perfect Murderer</h1>
<hr />
<p>Imagine if suddenly your heart comes out of your body! SCARY right! also it seems quite Sci-Fi. But this can be a reality if a person has an access to <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension and you don’t.</p>

<p><a href="/static/images/fourth-dimension/5.jpg" data-lightbox="/static/images/fourth-dimension/5.jpg" data-title="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true">
    <img class="ui large centered stylish image" src="/static/images/fourth-dimension/5.jpg" alt="The Fourth Dimension - too Sci-Fi to be true" />
</a></p>

<p>This guy can now become the perfect murderer because he don’t need any weapons to kill someone, neither he requires any extra equipments like poison, rope, etc. nor will he leave his fingerprints anywhere. He just needs to extend his hand along the <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension and put it inside you and mess with your internal organs, and you will be dead in seconds.</p>

<h1 id="some-pointers-to-think-about">Some pointers to think about</h1>
<hr />
<p>The examples I mentioned above are really vague, but this can be taken to altogether very different levels. If you can think along the lines you can try to answer the following pointers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if the <script type="math/tex">4D</script> creature intersects our <script type="math/tex">3D</script> world at more than one place.</li>
  <li>Do we now have an explanation of the powers of Nightcrawler in X-men?</li>
  <li>Can <script type="math/tex">4D</script> person see what you had in your breakfast?</li>
  <li>Can we say that <script type="math/tex">4D</script> person cannot be killed by a bullet?</li>
  <li>Can we create a lightning fast transport along <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension?</li>
  <li>Does this mean that <script type="math/tex">4^{th}</script> dimension plus Flash’s speed = Teleportation?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you really want to dive deep into this then just dive deep into your imaginations and jot your ideas.</p>

<p>What do you think about this? I would love to hear from you guys.</p>
