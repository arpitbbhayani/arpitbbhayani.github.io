        <title>FlaskSR - Make pages load faster</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FlaskSR provides an easy way to make flask pages load faster and better by streaming HTTP Responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-use-this&quot;&gt;Why should you use this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every web application tries to minimize the “Time to First Paint”. This can be done by streaming partial responses to client. FlaskSR enables this functionality in an easy way for &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Flask Web Framework&lt;/a&gt;. With FlaskSR you can start streaming partial HTTP responses depending on layout to client so that client starts seeing some content along the way instead of seeing all of the site’s content at once and thus making the pages load faster and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully compatible with Jinja templates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimizes Time for first paint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No impact on SEO - as nothing goes via AJAX calls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start rendering important part of your page first so user start seeing important things first.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improves perceived performance of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the extension with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install flasksr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flasksr-in-action&quot;&gt;FlaskSR in action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;ui large centered image&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4745789/19834915/7354d69a-9e9a-11e6-8ab6-b7b95146a25c.gif&quot; alt=&quot;FlaskSR Impact&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed, the FlaskSR is easy to use. Let’s walk through setting up a basic application. Also please note that this is a very basic guide: we will be taking shortcuts here that you should never take in a real application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin we’ll set up a Flask app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;flasksr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BasicSR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vm&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render_menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;        &amp;lt;ul style=&amp;quot;list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;News&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;        &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;        &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;margin-top: 50px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render_first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;        &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;                &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;FlaskSR Example&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render_last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;            &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;        &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@app.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BasicSR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vm&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;0.0.0.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>9 - Revenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With a wicked smile Kipo came out of the bathroom, full of confidence and strength, and started walking towards the war zone. For winning this war he needs to understand his “enemy” a little better. As he was in the passage he saw Nick coming towards him. Seeing Kipo, Nick rushed towards him and said “Where have you been? I searched for you everywhere!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is not important. Tell me what is the name of that huge-potato-porker-lard-ass?” asked Kipo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who?” asked Nick with a very confused expression. But as soon as he asked this, he realized whom Kipo was referring to, and he continued “His name is Roy, and the thin guy besides him is Bob; He is his sidekick”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo had another question ready in his mind and as Nick finished telling, Kipo asked “Tell me one thing that R..oy is scared of.”. Nick with full confidence answered “LIZARDS! Everyone in the school know this. There is is very funny incident ……”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A … a … a…. a ….” Kipo stopped him and said “later … later …. We don’t have time, please go to the class room and get me my bag. I will wait in the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick rushed to the classroom, grabbed Kipo’s bag and came back to the bathroom. Kipo just like a mad scientist wanting to create Frankenstein, started tearing pages and making something. After some cuts and folds he showed what he created to Nick and said “Does this look like a lizard?”. Nick was surprised to see how quickly Kipo managed to create a lizard from just a mere piece of paper. He replied “Yes it does look like a lizard! If you color it, it would be better”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo had already though of painting it, so he took out the new oil paint colors, he had brought with him, from his bag and started painting it. Once he finished it, he showed it to Nick,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick was astounded to see this scarily painted origami lizard. It looked scary real!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They went to the classroom, everyone started giving Kipo a look. He did not like it but he knew that if his plan worked, tables will be turn. Kipo took the lead and went behind Roy, took out the fake lizard and threw it onto him. This scary little lizard scared the bejesus out of him and he screamed and ran away; and with him ran Bob, his sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the class started laughing and clapping for Kipo, which made him feel special. Kipo and Nick then took back their seats; and as they sat, a pretty looking lady came into the class and said “Good Morning Students!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen when Roy and Bob returns? A fight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8 - I Am Tough Within</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After being pushed to the ground, Kipo was hurt, he was in pain. As he tried to stand on his feet, all he saw was a huge-guy who pushed him down. With the pain he was experiencing and the thought of what others might think of him, he broke into tears. He ran towards the bathroom and locked himself up in a toilet. He was experiencing a whirlpool of feelings; He was sad, angry, hurt and worried at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought of running away to home and skip the school with a hope that everyone forgets everything that happened by tomorrow and he would have a fresh start. But then all the consequences came to his mind and the scenarios were worse than what had happened to him. He understood that running away from the problem is not a solution to it. He became angrier and angrier; as he almost lost his cool he told himself “You may cry, but you are tough within!” which urged him to go, fight and beat that huge-potato guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He angrily opened the door and started rushing towards the classroom but after few quick steps, he recalled a teaching from his grandpa, “No matter the situation don’t let your emotions overpower”. So he kept his calm and returned back to the toilet seat and started thinking of some way that he could teach that huge-potato-porker a lesson. It was getting harder for Kipo to add more and more adjectives to the name. Several ideas strike his mind; some were silly, some were cruel and some were funny. They were funny enough to lighten Kipo’s mood and bring a smile to his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calmed down and starting thinking ideas through. He narrowed down to one that was a perfect blend; it was funny, cruel and silly at the same time and it also served the purpose of teaching that huge-potato-porker-lard-ass a lesson. With a wicked smile on his face, he opened the door and stared moving towards the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the plan?
If the plan backfires, will he get his head squished by huge-potato-porker-lard-ass?
Where was Nick when Kipo locked himself up?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 - The New Friend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kipo boarded the bus. Seeing so many new faces around, he was excited yet nervous. As he entered, he started looking for a seat. After skimming the bus a few times, he found one in the second row from the last. He knew would be the “New Kid” in school and will be bombarded with questions so he started preparing them in mind one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kipo was in middle of preparing his answer to the typical Hobby question, someone tapped him on his shoulder. Kipo turned and saw a kid wearing thick round glasses, he looked nerdy. The kid introduced himself with a lot of excitement and punch in his voice “Hi! I am Nick”. Kipo nervously replied “Iiiii …. aaammmm …. Kipo”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After few ice-breakers they both started knowing each other a little better. One thing led to another and they found out that they both were 7th graders and will be attending the same class. Kipo was really happy to know this. After sometime, Nick went and called some of his other friends and introduced them to Kipo. It was hard for him to remember names of all he met but he was relieved, at least he will see some known faces in school now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have reached! Get off quickly” shouted the bus driver. Everyone rushed towards the door to get off. Nick and Kipo started walking towards the classroom. While they were on their way, Nick started telling Kipo about the activities they have in school - quizzing, sports, drama, dancing and painting, which made Kipo really excited and he felt he was in right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they reached the classroom, Kipo and Nick started looking for a place. In the third row there was a seat for two available. They both went to the seat, to keep their bags. As Kipo was keeping his bag on the bench, someone pushed him. The push was powerful, Kipo lost his balance and fell on the floor. He heard a tough voice say “This is my seat! Go sit somewhere else!”. The turned and saw someone big!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Kipo in trouble?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 - I Am Ready</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“beep beep beep beep  … ” the alarm rang at 5:30 in the morning and woke Kipo up. With lots of butterflies in his stomach, Kipo woke up at once. Today is his first day at new school “The Blend” where he is joining 7th Grade; Yes! Kipo is a big boy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He woke up and ran directly to the bathroom, took out his toothbrush &amp;amp; toothpaste and started brushing his teeth. It was only 5:40 now and he had a lot of time to spare as the school bus was going to pick him up at 7 a.m. Instead of thinking of taking a quick nap, Kipo decided to take a shower as he did not want his quick nap getting converted to a long sleep, and be late on his first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his shower he ran to cupboard, picked up his new pair of shoes, his new uniform and his bright green tie. He was really very happy about it. He then quickly ran to his study desk and started packing his school bag for his first day. He did not forget to take his new set of Oil Paint Colors for which he fought hard with his Mum and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was done, somewhere around 6:30, he shouted a loud … “I am Ready!”. Everyone in his house was happy to see the excitement on Kipo’s face; but deep inside Kipo was nervous, was sad. He knew he will be all alone in this new school. He knew no one there, no friends, no acquaintances; He was unhappy about his Dad deciding to move to his new city but he had no choice. He did not want to leave his old city, friends, school but …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping everything would be alright on the first day he boarded the school bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Kipo like this change?
Will Kipo continue to miss his old city, school and friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 - The Confrontation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as Mr. Cup finished making his boat, the doorbell rang. He quickly got up, cleaned up the mess and opened the door. Nervously he uttered “H…ee…lloooo …. guys!”. All of the friends greeted him together “Hello, Kipo!”. The real name of Mr. Cup is Kipo but he do not like his name so he makes everyone call him Mr. Cup; but no one actually does. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since luck has never been on his side, his friend, Gitto, out of nowhere, suggested all to play with air-plane again. Everyone got excited but Kipo got scared. He tried really hard to detour but it did not work. Everyone started inquiring about the air-plane; feeling the heat, Kipo ran into his room and grabbed the boat and very excitedly showed it to all of his friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat was pretty impressive and beautiful and big! Some of them had never seen anything like that before. Everyone got pretty excited seeing it, and wanted to play with it. Kipo started telling them about how he made it and what all it can do. Some of it was total hocus-pocus but they bought it. Meanwhile Gypsy ran towards bathroom, filled the bathtub with water and called everyone with the Boat. He snatched the Boat from Kipo’s hand and put it in water. The boat floated! it went with the stream from one end to the other. Kipo was relieved. 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was so happy with the Boat that they forgot about the air-plane. Because all they cared  about being happy, and they were happy with Boat right now. They were live-the-present-and-forget-the-past kinda cups 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo, our Mr. Cup had a new learning today - “The worst always happens in your mind, not in reality”. Holidays are over; everything almost went well for Kipo this summer. But tomorrow is the first day of new academic year at school. Something interesting is bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 - The Thinking Cap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The air-plane burnt and with it burned all the hopes of fixing it. Mr. Cup now just wanted things to be the way they were, but the series of events that happened were like a tracer bullet, shot from a gun, you can’t take it back; irreversible as some might say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shocked from what he did, he sat on his favourite saucer, put on his thinking cap and started finding some way out which is both possible and feasible. As he was thinking for some solution, something clicked, the bulb in his mind glowed and he decided to build his own air-plane, which should ideally be like the old one, and hope that no one would notice the change. The only problem with this idea was - he did not know how to build one. But still he gave this a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ran into his room, grabbed some paper, a scissor, a measuring tape and some glue. He started folding the paper in random directions, hoping it takes the shape of the air-plane. It was harder than he thought; he knew what he wanted to make, but the shapes he was creating were in no way looking like it, forget its capability of taking-off and flying high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about the time when he thought of giving up, he calmed down, took a deep breath and chose to give this one last shot. He folded the paper neatly, divided it in half, then to a quarter, made some slant folds, then using scissor made some crisp cuts, glued small bits of paper together and to his surprise it started taking some familiar shape. So the chose to continue with it. The shape was neat, crisp and looked pretty impressive. He realised that he accidentally made a Boat out of it and that too a beautiful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boat instead of an air-plane … will his friends accept?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If put it in water … will this boat float?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 - Panic Mode Is On</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as Mr. Cup saw the air-plane soaked in water, he panicked. Now all he wanted was to somehow fix it. The panic button was pressed and the panic mode was on! A torrent of possible fixes struck his mind, which confused him badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started mopping away water from the floor. Things started off well, he thought “Well began is half done”. But little did he know, fate had some other plans for him 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought, if Blow Dryer could dry hair so neatly, it could also dry the air-plane. Feeling excited about his idea, he quickly grabbed a Blow Dryer, plugged it in and started blowing hot air to the plane. As the first stream of hot air hit the air-plane, it took-off. He chased the plane but the it kept going around. He tried several times but the plane was adamant and didn’t want to stay grounded. Giving up on this idea, he thought of something which did not make the plane go whooooossssshhhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Blow-Drying, Mr. Cup thought of Sun-Drying; so he took the plane out in the sun. He waited and waited but nothing much happened; he realised it will take hours to dry and he didn’t have that much time. So he wanted something to speedup the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suddenly recalled something he studied in his science class. He went to his bedroom and grabbed his magnifying glass and focused it on the air-plane. Things started to speedup, he became happy and relieved that things were working out. But in some time he smelled something fishy! He looked down and to his surprise he saw, one of the wings caught fire. He did not expect this to happen; but it did! He immediately threw his magnifying glass away, but it was too late … the air-plane was ruined ☹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did he put himself in some serious trouble?
Will anything good ever happen to him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 - Something Broke</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cup saw some water spilled over the airplane. He is afraid that he may have accidentally broken everyone’s favourite toy and once his friends find out this, they might stop hanging out with him and he will be all alone, just like the old times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cup is surely over thinking but his past made him to over think and be skeptical over everything. Back then he used to have his meals alone every single day. He was so alone that the only acquaintance he had was the delivery guy who used to deliver pizza to his place. Poor guy 😔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now his life changed, he has a “life”, he has some amazing friends and he doesn’t want to lose them at any cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was Mr. Cup so alone, did anything terrible happened?
Will friends find out about broken airplane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1 - Something Happened</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cup did something really horrible ☹ and is ignoring everyone right now, hoping no one finds out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Mr. Cup do?
Will anyone find out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
