        <title>Why Freshers Are Awesome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Freshers is the term we all have been (or will be) associated with, generally referring to someone who just graduated and is fresh out of college. Every organization hires some freshers, but why? Why is company paying someone who has no experience and no exposure? Obviously the giants are not nuts to hire someone they don‚Äôt see any value. Hence I tried to compile my thoughts on ‚ÄúWhy Freshers Are Awesome?‚Äù. Before you think of giving this a read I would request you to please make a note that these are my opinions and I am not always correct üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-wave-of-freshness&quot;&gt;New wave of freshness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshers bring in new wave of freshness to an organization that might have lost its luster and peppiness. This new wave brings some ‚Äúmodern‚Äù fashion sense, different hair and beard styles, latest trends and of course ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;THE SWAG&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù (as the youngs calls it). This wave is essential for any organization to keep its culture up-to-date, lively, spicy and upbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unbiased-perspective-to-problem-solving&quot;&gt;Unbiased Perspective to Problem Solving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasoned employees are used to facing problems and solving it with some preferred approach. But when the same problem is given to a person that has never seen it before, he/she might give you some suggestions and hints that could result in solving the problem far more efficiently. That is why every team has some freshers and their opinions does matter as they might have suggestions that are relatively unheard of and could help tackle problem with some different unconventional way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bridging-the-gap&quot;&gt;Bridging the Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every hour a new library, utility, product, tool or language is popping up and for seasoned employees it is very hard to stay updated with it. Because of this most seasoned employees are master a set of tools and technologies and they refrain from evaluating and adopting new tech. On the other hand freshers always try to keep themselves updated with latest tech and because of their huge motivation level they keep on learning new things. Freshers bring with them new technologies and experiences and thus bridge the technology gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-go-to-ones&quot;&gt;The Go-To Ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a project is ‚Äúdead‚Äù and everyone refuses to work on it because it is either too simple or mundane or just that no one wants to do it, it is given to a fresher as a ‚Äúlearning‚Äù task and thus they bring it to ‚Äúlife‚Äù. When seniors don‚Äôt feel like working on a easy module they ask for some freshers to do it. When system designers (principal architect) wants to do some proof-of-concept of their theory/approach they ask some freshers to code it. Thus freshers become the most important ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù guys of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-motivated-unit&quot;&gt;The Motivated Unit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their zeal to learn and grow, freshers are probably the only ‚Äúmotivated unit‚Äù of an organization. The seniors and seasoned employee have seen and have been through enough in their work and personal life that they just work for sake of money and keeping up with all the bills. Freshers single handedly bring the overall motivation level of the company up and unknowingly ensures that things are moving at a brisk pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;covering-up&quot;&gt;Covering up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article may make you feel like seniors and experiences people are lazy and jerks; but that is not the case. Its just that they focus more on solving ‚Äúbigger‚Äù problems and leave mediocre ones and implementations to freshers and juniors. Most of the seniors have a family to look after and thus have to juggle between so many things that they cannot give their 100% at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I am a Senior Backend Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beware of - Which indian celebrity do you look like?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For last 3 odd days my &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; Wall is flooded with post that looks something like above where almost every single friend of mine has posted ‚ÄúWhich celebrity he looked like‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was not inclined to try this and for me all such things are mumbo jumbo. But then as this ritual was growing and was getting accepted at a huge pace, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy Not?‚Äù; and I gave it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I clicked on the link I was redirected to the page full of advertisements; and then I clicked the link that asked me to ‚ÄúLogin via Facebook‚Äù. It redirected me to an ‚ÄúOAuth Dialog‚Äù and asked me for some permission. The set of permissions it asked me were insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;ui centered medium image&quot; src=&quot;/static/images/indian-celebrity/oauth-dialog.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered ‚ÄúWhy an app like this needs to access my ‚ÄúTimeline post‚Äô?‚Äù. Hence instead of clicking ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù but I clicked ‚ÄúEdit this‚Äù and edited the set of information that Facebook should share with this app about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;ui centered medium image&quot; src=&quot;/static/images/indian-celebrity/permissions-asked.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-i-do-this&quot;&gt;Why did I do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application that asks you to login via Facebook, can ask any kind of information from Facebook about you. But Facebook before giving away all information asked to that app, first consults you and asks for your permission, and gives you a chance to edit it. Most of the users do not bother to edit it; and because of which sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://catfly.in/&quot;&gt;Cat Fly Quizzes&lt;/a&gt; gets all of your information, with your consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-might-happen-when-such-app-gets-my-information&quot;&gt;What might happen when such app gets my information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such app/websites may:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell this data to some fraudulent entity which engages in sending spams or scams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create fake profiles on different platforms and use it for illegal activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misuse your photos and data to blackmail someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tonnes of scarier scenarios but I am avoiding writing it. Just remember nothing on Internet you share is safe. Don‚Äôt trust something just because your friend trusts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-revoke-the-permission-that-i-granted&quot;&gt;Can I revoke the permission that I granted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES. A big YES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can revoke the permission that you granted to an app by going to your ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù in your Facebook account. Here is a small video I made that would guide you to revoke the permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned basic segment&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SjlXpUNrBM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revoking the permission will prevent such apps from getting your data again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-you-should-always-remember&quot;&gt;Things you should always remember&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever you login via Facebook or Google or any such site, please read the list of information that it will share with the app on your behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you dont want to share some or all of the information, you can change it from the OAuth dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have already granted some app the permissions, you can anytime revoke them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a dangerous world out there on the internet, stay safe!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tripod - Fast in-memory prefix search in Go</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/arpitbbhayani/tripod&quot;&gt;Tripod&lt;/a&gt; provides fast and optimal search-by-prefix utilities in Go. For now it uses an in-memory trie data structure to store all the string on which you want to do a prefix search. There two implementations: one that store byte splices and other that store rune splices. The primary difference between the two is the that the later one stores data rune by rune (which makes a logical sense), so even if you have UTF-8 characters, the rune based implementation will take care of it. On the other hand the byte splice based implementation is optimized for ascii string, where one byte is enough to store a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;highlights&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PrefixStoreByteTrie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 bytes of garbage allocation for &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Exists&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimal and predictable allocations &lt;code&gt;(3 * (numOfElementsRetrieved) + 2)&lt;/code&gt; for
&lt;code&gt;PrefixSearch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrefixStoreRuneTrie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 bytes of garbage allocation for &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Exists&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimal and predictable allocations &lt;code&gt;(3 * (numOfElementsRetrieved) + 2)&lt;/code&gt; for
&lt;code&gt;PrefixSearch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can safely store UTF-8 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prefix-stores&quot;&gt;Prefix Stores&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PrefixStore is where you will store your prefix. You will call &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exists&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;PrefixSearch&lt;/code&gt; on its instance. There are several type of implementations
available for this. Each implementation of Prefix Store has some tailor-made
optimization on method calls for type of data it can store. Following are the
types available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prefixstorebytetrie&quot;&gt;PrefixStoreByteTrie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PrefixStore is implemented via an in-memory trie capable of storing only
&lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;. This should be used when you know that the data you would put in only
has ASCII characters. No one is stopping you from putting any kind of &lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prefixstorerunetrie&quot;&gt;PrefixStoreRuneTrie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PrefixStore is implemented via an in-memory trie capable of storing only
&lt;code&gt;[]rune&lt;/code&gt;. This is useful when you want to store data that might have
UTF-8 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;go get github.com/arpitbbhayani/tripod&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>9 - Revenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With a wicked smile Kipo came out of the bathroom, full of confidence and strength, and started walking towards the war zone. For winning this war he needs to understand his ‚Äúenemy‚Äù a little better. As he was in the passage he saw Nick coming towards him. Seeing Kipo, Nick rushed towards him and said ‚ÄúWhere have you been? I searched for you everywhere!‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat is not important. Tell me what is the name of that huge-potato-porker-lard-ass?‚Äù asked Kipo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWho?‚Äù asked Nick with a very confused expression. But as soon as he asked this, he realized whom Kipo was referring to, and he continued ‚ÄúHis name is Roy, and the thin guy besides him is Bob; He is his sidekick‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo had another question ready in his mind and as Nick finished telling, Kipo asked ‚ÄúTell me one thing that R..oy is scared of.‚Äù. Nick with full confidence answered ‚ÄúLIZARDS! Everyone in the school know this. There is is very funny incident ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúA ‚Ä¶ a ‚Ä¶ a‚Ä¶. a ‚Ä¶.‚Äù Kipo stopped him and said ‚Äúlater ‚Ä¶ later ‚Ä¶. We don‚Äôt have time, please go to the class room and get me my bag. I will wait in the bathroom.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick rushed to the classroom, grabbed Kipo‚Äôs bag and came back to the bathroom. Kipo just like a mad scientist wanting to create Frankenstein, started tearing pages and making something. After some cuts and folds he showed what he created to Nick and said ‚ÄúDoes this look like a lizard?‚Äù. Nick was surprised to see how quickly Kipo managed to create a lizard from just a mere piece of paper. He replied ‚ÄúYes it does look like a lizard! If you color it, it would be better‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo had already though of painting it, so he took out the new oil paint colors, he had brought with him, from his bag and started painting it. Once he finished it, he showed it to Nick,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick was astounded to see this scarily painted origami lizard. It looked scary real!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They went to the classroom, everyone started giving Kipo a look. He did not like it but he knew that if his plan worked, tables will be turn. Kipo took the lead and went behind Roy, took out the fake lizard and threw it onto him. This scary little lizard scared the bejesus out of him and he screamed and ran away; and with him ran Bob, his sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the class started laughing and clapping for Kipo, which made him feel special. Kipo and Nick then took back their seats; and as they sat, a pretty looking lady came into the class and said ‚ÄúGood Morning Students!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen when Roy and Bob returns? A fight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8 - I Am Tough Within</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After being pushed to the ground, Kipo was hurt, he was in pain. As he tried to stand on his feet, all he saw was a huge-guy who pushed him down. With the pain he was experiencing and the thought of what others might think of him, he broke into tears. He ran towards the bathroom and locked himself up in a toilet. He was experiencing a whirlpool of feelings; He was sad, angry, hurt and worried at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought of running away to home and skip the school with a hope that everyone forgets everything that happened by tomorrow and he would have a fresh start. But then all the consequences came to his mind and the scenarios were worse than what had happened to him. He understood that running away from the problem is not a solution to it. He became angrier and angrier; as he almost lost his cool he told himself ‚ÄúYou may cry, but you are tough within!‚Äù which urged him to go, fight and beat that huge-potato guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He angrily opened the door and started rushing towards the classroom but after few quick steps, he recalled a teaching from his grandpa, ‚ÄúNo matter the situation don‚Äôt let your emotions overpower‚Äù. So he kept his calm and returned back to the toilet seat and started thinking of some way that he could teach that huge-potato-porker a lesson. It was getting harder for Kipo to add more and more adjectives to the name. Several ideas strike his mind; some were silly, some were cruel and some were funny. They were funny enough to lighten Kipo‚Äôs mood and bring a smile to his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calmed down and starting thinking ideas through. He narrowed down to one that was a perfect blend; it was funny, cruel and silly at the same time and it also served the purpose of teaching that huge-potato-porker-lard-ass a lesson. With a wicked smile on his face, he opened the door and stared moving towards the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the plan?
If the plan backfires, will he get his head squished by huge-potato-porker-lard-ass?
Where was Nick when Kipo locked himself up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 - The New Friend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kipo boarded the bus. Seeing so many new faces around, he was excited yet nervous. As he entered, he started looking for a seat. After skimming the bus a few times, he found one in the second row from the last. He knew would be the ‚ÄúNew Kid‚Äù in school and will be bombarded with questions so he started preparing them in mind one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kipo was in middle of preparing his answer to the typical Hobby question, someone tapped him on his shoulder. Kipo turned and saw a kid wearing thick round glasses, he looked nerdy. The kid introduced himself with a lot of excitement and punch in his voice ‚ÄúHi! I am Nick‚Äù. Kipo nervously replied ‚ÄúIiiii ‚Ä¶. aaammmm ‚Ä¶. Kipo‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After few ice-breakers they both started knowing each other a little better. One thing led to another and they found out that they both were 7th graders and will be attending the same class. Kipo was really happy to know this. After sometime, Nick went and called some of his other friends and introduced them to Kipo. It was hard for him to remember names of all he met but he was relieved, at least he will see some known faces in school now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have reached! Get off quickly‚Äù shouted the bus driver. Everyone rushed towards the door to get off. Nick and Kipo started walking towards the classroom. While they were on their way, Nick started telling Kipo about the activities they have in school - quizzing, sports, drama, dancing and painting, which made Kipo really excited and he felt he was in right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they reached the classroom, Kipo and Nick started looking for a place. In the third row there was a seat for two available. They both went to the seat, to keep their bags. As Kipo was keeping his bag on the bench, someone pushed him. The push was powerful, Kipo lost his balance and fell on the floor. He heard a tough voice say ‚ÄúThis is my seat! Go sit somewhere else!‚Äù. The turned and saw someone big!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Kipo in trouble?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 - I Am Ready</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚Äúbeep beep beep beep  ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù the alarm rang at 5:30 in the morning and woke Kipo up. With lots of butterflies in his stomach, Kipo woke up at once. Today is his first day at new school ‚ÄúThe Blend‚Äù where he is joining 7th Grade; Yes! Kipo is a big boy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He woke up and ran directly to the bathroom, took out his toothbrush &amp;amp; toothpaste and started brushing his teeth. It was only 5:40 now and he had a lot of time to spare as the school bus was going to pick him up at 7 a.m. Instead of thinking of taking a quick nap, Kipo decided to take a shower as he did not want his quick nap getting converted to a long sleep, and be late on his first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his shower he ran to cupboard, picked up his new pair of shoes, his new uniform and his bright green tie. He was really very happy about it. He then quickly ran to his study desk and started packing his school bag for his first day. He did not forget to take his new set of Oil Paint Colors for which he fought hard with his Mum and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was done, somewhere around 6:30, he shouted a loud ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI am Ready!‚Äù. Everyone in his house was happy to see the excitement on Kipo‚Äôs face; but deep inside Kipo was nervous, was sad. He knew he will be all alone in this new school. He knew no one there, no friends, no acquaintances; He was unhappy about his Dad deciding to move to his new city but he had no choice. He did not want to leave his old city, friends, school but ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping everything would be alright on the first day he boarded the school bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Kipo like this change?
Will Kipo continue to miss his old city, school and friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 - The Confrontation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as Mr. Cup finished making his boat, the doorbell rang. He quickly got up, cleaned up the mess and opened the door. Nervously he uttered ‚ÄúH‚Ä¶ee‚Ä¶lloooo ‚Ä¶. guys!‚Äù. All of the friends greeted him together ‚ÄúHello, Kipo!‚Äù. The real name of Mr. Cup is Kipo but he do not like his name so he makes everyone call him Mr. Cup; but no one actually does. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since luck has never been on his side, his friend, Gitto, out of nowhere, suggested all to play with air-plane again. Everyone got excited but Kipo got scared. He tried really hard to detour but it did not work. Everyone started inquiring about the air-plane; feeling the heat, Kipo ran into his room and grabbed the boat and very excitedly showed it to all of his friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat was pretty impressive and beautiful and big! Some of them had never seen anything like that before. Everyone got pretty excited seeing it, and wanted to play with it. Kipo started telling them about how he made it and what all it can do. Some of it was total hocus-pocus but they bought it. Meanwhile Gypsy ran towards bathroom, filled the bathtub with water and called everyone with the Boat. He snatched the Boat from Kipo‚Äôs hand and put it in water. The boat floated! it went with the stream from one end to the other. Kipo was relieved. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was so happy with the Boat that they forgot about the air-plane. Because all they cared  about being happy, and they were happy with Boat right now. They were live-the-present-and-forget-the-past kinda cups üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipo, our Mr. Cup had a new learning today - ‚ÄúThe worst always happens in your mind, not in reality‚Äù. Holidays are over; everything almost went well for Kipo this summer. But tomorrow is the first day of new academic year at school. Something interesting is bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 - The Thinking Cap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The air-plane burnt and with it burned all the hopes of fixing it. Mr. Cup now just wanted things to be the way they were, but the series of events that happened were like a tracer bullet, shot from a gun, you can‚Äôt take it back; irreversible as some might say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shocked from what he did, he sat on his favourite saucer, put on his thinking cap and started finding some way out which is both possible and feasible. As he was thinking for some solution, something clicked, the bulb in his mind glowed and he decided to build his own air-plane, which should ideally be like the old one, and hope that no one would notice the change. The only problem with this idea was - he did not know how to build one. But still he gave this a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ran into his room, grabbed some paper, a scissor, a measuring tape and some glue. He started folding the paper in random directions, hoping it takes the shape of the air-plane. It was harder than he thought; he knew what he wanted to make, but the shapes he was creating were in no way looking like it, forget its capability of taking-off and flying high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about the time when he thought of giving up, he calmed down, took a deep breath and chose to give this one last shot. He folded the paper neatly, divided it in half, then to a quarter, made some slant folds, then using scissor made some crisp cuts, glued small bits of paper together and to his surprise it started taking some familiar shape. So the chose to continue with it. The shape was neat, crisp and looked pretty impressive. He realised that he accidentally made a Boat out of it and that too a beautiful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boat instead of an air-plane ‚Ä¶ will his friends accept?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If put it in water ‚Ä¶ will this boat float?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 - Panic Mode Is On</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as Mr. Cup saw the air-plane soaked in water, he panicked. Now all he wanted was to somehow fix it. The panic button was pressed and the panic mode was on! A torrent of possible fixes struck his mind, which confused him badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started mopping away water from the floor. Things started off well, he thought ‚ÄúWell began is half done‚Äù. But little did he know, fate had some other plans for him üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought, if Blow Dryer could dry hair so neatly, it could also dry the air-plane. Feeling excited about his idea, he quickly grabbed a Blow Dryer, plugged it in and started blowing hot air to the plane. As the first stream of hot air hit the air-plane, it took-off. He chased the plane but the it kept going around. He tried several times but the plane was adamant and didn‚Äôt want to stay grounded. Giving up on this idea, he thought of something which did not make the plane go whooooossssshhhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Blow-Drying, Mr. Cup thought of Sun-Drying; so he took the plane out in the sun. He waited and waited but nothing much happened; he realised it will take hours to dry and he didn‚Äôt have that much time. So he wanted something to speedup the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suddenly recalled something he studied in his science class. He went to his bedroom and grabbed his magnifying glass and focused it on the air-plane. Things started to speedup, he became happy and relieved that things were working out. But in some time he smelled something fishy! He looked down and to his surprise he saw, one of the wings caught fire. He did not expect this to happen; but it did! He immediately threw his magnifying glass away, but it was too late ‚Ä¶ the air-plane was ruined ‚òπ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did he put himself in some serious trouble?
Will anything good ever happen to him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/p&gt;
